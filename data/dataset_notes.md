# Remarks on the datasets

## sat.csv

I added the variable **frac_category** to indicate whether each state a low, medium or high percentage of students taking the SAT.

## influential.csv

Ten points are in a random cloud, and one is influential.  Students should change the y-coordinate of the influential point to see a big change in the regression line.

## outlier.csv

41 points are in a rising cloud. Another point is an outlier, but is not influential.  student can see that changing the y-coordinate of this point does not have much effect on the regression line.
